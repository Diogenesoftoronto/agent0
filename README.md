# 🤖 Agent0: Vera (Bun Agent Project)

Agent0 exists because I wanted a better Discord bot than what I experienced in the Latent Space server. That bot could spin up threads from tweets with summaries and an xcancel link. Vera does that too, and also remembers people in chat so you can ask about prior conversations or users.

## 🌟 What is Vera?

Vera is more than just a chatbot. She is an AI agent capable of:
- **Summarizing Links**: Automatically provides summaries for shared URLs.
- **Unrolling Tweets**: Fetches and displays full threads from X/Twitter links.
- **Remembering Context**: Keeps track of conversations and learns facts about the server and users.
- **Engaging Conversation**: Offers friendly and context-aware chat.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Bun**: Version 1.2.4 or higher
- **Discord Bot Token**: You need a bot application created in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, log in:

```bash
agentuity login
```

### 1. Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or use the existing one) and add your Discord application credentials and Google API key:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=your_discord_application_id_here
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=your_discord_public_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

*Note: If you are using Agentuity features, ensure your `AGENTUITY_API_KEY` is also set. For sensitive values, prefer `agentuity env set --secret ...`.*

You can set environment variables via Agentuity:

```bash
agentuity env set DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY $DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
agentuity env set --secret DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID $DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID
agentuity env set --secret DISCORD_TOKEN $DISCORD_TOKEN
agentuity env set --secret GOOGLE_API_KEY $GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### Create a new agent (optional)

```bash
agentuity agent new
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Run the Bot

You can start the bot in development mode using:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

Or directly via Bun:

```bash
bun run start
```

The bot will log in and print `Ready! Logged in as [Tag]` to the console.

## 🌐 Deployment

When you're ready to deploy to Agentuity Cloud:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```
